Sheno DB Manifesto:

Sheno DB is a rust-based database project which aims to address modularity concerns of traditional
relational databases.

It believes that by breaking down the traditional monolithic architecture of databases into smaller, more focused modules, it can increase the overall reliability and scalability of database systems. The modular design of Sheno DB allows for easy substitution of specific modules, making it possible to customize the database to specific use cases and requirements.

Overall, the Sheno DB Manifesto represents a new and innovative approach to database design and implementation. By combining the best of both low-level and high-level programming, and by providing a modular, scalable, and concurrent system, Sheno DB is poised to become the next-generation database for the modern era.
